# Weekly Snippets

*Note:*

*LAST WEEK: one sentence per person.*
*NEXT WEEK: 3 sentences total.*

## Week 9

### LAST WEEK

Kejia: coded up Bayes by Backprop on MNIST. (not using `Edward`)
Zhirui: coded up and tested a minimal Bayesian RNN with a slice of real dataset.

### NEXT WEEK

a. Edit Bayes by Backprop to a RNN batch setting.
b. Troubleshoot Bayesian RNN.
c. Setup repository and sort current code.

## Week 10

### LAST WEEK

Kejia: coded up and tested Bayes by Backprop in RNN batch settings.
Zhirui: coded up and tested 1-layer Bayesian neural network models (Dense, RNN, LSTM, GRU).

### NEXT WEEK

a. Tuning complicated structures to get better performance.
b. Further implement Bayes by Backprop with posterior sharpening and with `Edward`.
c. Discuss repository and code very soon. (shifting from last week)
